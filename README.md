## Chatbot with Neural Network

# Overview

This project implements a chatbot using a neural network for natural language understanding. The chatbot can respond to user inputs based on a predefined set of intents and patterns. It uses PyTorch for building and training the neural network and NLTK for text processing.

# Features
- Tokenization and stemming of input sentences
- Conversion of sentences to bag-of-words representations
- Training of a neural network for intent classification
- Real-time chat interface

# Installation

To run this project, you'll need to install the following packages:

    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
    pip install nltk
